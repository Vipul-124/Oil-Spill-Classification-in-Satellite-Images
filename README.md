# Oil-Spill-Classification-in-Satellite-Images

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify if the oil is spilled or not in the ocean by using satellite images dataset. The dataset was obtained from a reliable source, and different classification algorithms were implemented, including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Bagging Classifier. The model with the highest accuracy was saved using the pickle library. The Bagging Classifier achieved an accuracy of 97%, making it the best-performing model.

## Project Structure:

- Code: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook with the code for the project.
